<p style="text-align: center;">As the qoute above shows, this page will talk about family... Specifically, my family</p>

<ul>

	<div class="b">

	</div>

	<div class="a">
		<p>Growing up in a Catholic household, my father is the youngest of eight. He was an athlete in school and stayed active after college.</p>

		<p>He is a kind but serious man, someone who values an honesty and character.</p>
		<p>Parenting style: Independence.</p>
		<p>He raised my brother and me to be able to stand on our own — so that when we grow up, we’re not </p>
		<p>fragile birds waiting for mom and dad to feed us. We survive. On our own.</p>

  <div style="text-indent: 50px;">
    <p>My mother, the eldest of three, in a Catholic household. When she wasn't in school, she was helping around the house or on the farm. Hard work was just life.</p>
    <p>She is a disciplined woman. She expects proper manners, keep the house clean, and always be presentable.</p>
	<p>She reminds me to shave my beard. Every. Time.</p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>My brother</strong></p>

	</div>

	<div class="c">
		<p>My only younger brother. Five years apart.</p>

		<p>He plans to take Civil Engineering in college.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, he's just like me: into games, creative, stubborn, hot-headed.</p>
		
		<p>Other times, he is the total opposite: more artistic, better visual, artist, and does not have my passion for anime.</p>


		<p>But still, he's my brother. </p>
		
		<p>My only brother.</p>
